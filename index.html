        Well, I'm finally getting used to git. To you this may sound like
        </p><blockquote>&quot;well, I'm finally getting used to eating with cutlery&quot;</blockquote>
        <p>and you'd be right!</p><p>
        I started having a rusting, corrosive interest in the world of programming at the tender age of 15. Two
        years later I became aware of what Linux was and managed to install my first Slackware on the home, family
        shared computer. I say corrosive because this didn't come to me for free: my high school grades dropped
        and my list of excuses for not going out to play with my friends grew.
        </p><p>
        This was 1996. <em>A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</em>
        </p><p>
        It's only now in 2023 that I get to socialise with people interested in all of this and, I get to work on real
        world projects, using the latest trends in languages and frameworks. These are things I've refused to use
        before. I wanted to learn how things worked, how a graphics library does its magic; I wanted to be independent
        from major upgrades in libraries that break your code. So I stuck to established languages and no frameworks,
        unless utterly necessary.
        </p><p>
        I've definitely discovered cutlery!
        </p><p>
        Nevertheless, this website, space, blog, I don't know what shape it's going to take! -- I
        have to start somewhere, so it's being written the old fashioned way for now: Plain HTML (and some CSS; hey,
        I'm a cave man with a minimum of style!).
