        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
        This site's objective is to showcase all the (good) projects I come up with.
        I've had many projects that got lost in history, which would've been awesome
        to share. They were part of my history and, even if the projects themselves
        as a product don't exist anymore, being able to share the thought process that
        lead me to work on them would've been like taking a special
        kind of picture of my life at those times, as it happens with artists, I suppose.
        </p><p>
        Given the way I've evolved and the way technology has changed, there's no way I'll
        ever repeat those projects again.
        </p><p>
        With this site, I hope to document what goes through my head as I produce...
        stuff, and even write some thoughts on what I like, what I enjoy, what I miss and
        so on. Said this way, it feels like I should start a Youtube channel but, besides all the
        equipment I'd need, I think I enjoy more writing and documenting.
        </p>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm currently a software engineer at an Australian data consultancy company.
        My previous jobs during my life in Australia were all technical in nature.
        I always thrived in repair workshops, finding faults.
        </p><p>
        I have no formal education in computer science, or programming, but I do my 
        best to learn on my own. I have a few years of study in electronics, which
        helped me immensely to stand out at my technical positions.
